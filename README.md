# 🤖 Adaptive & Learning NPCs with Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to develop non-player characters (NPCs) in games that can adapt and learn from their environment. By leveraging RL techniques, these NPCs can make decisions based on interactions, leading to more dynamic and engaging gameplay experiences.

# 🧠 Project Overview

The core idea is to implement reinforcement learning algorithms to enable NPCs to:

Learn optimal behaviors through trial-and-error interactions within the game environment.
Adapt their strategies based on player actions and environmental changes.
Enhance the realism and challenge of the game by exhibiting intelligent behaviors.
GitHub
The project utilizes Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation, providing an interactive platform to test and visualize the learning process of NPCs.

# 📚 Reinforcement Learning in Gaming

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn optimal behaviors through interactions with an environment. In the context of gaming, RL enables NPCs to:
DEV Community

-Adapt to player strategies, providing a dynamic challenge.
-Develop complex behaviors without explicit programming.
-Enhance player engagement through unpredictable and intelligent responses.

By integrating RL, game developers can create more immersive and responsive game worlds.
